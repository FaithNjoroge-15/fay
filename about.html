            <p>
                Hello, I'm Faith Njoroge, a passionate software developer with a focus on Frontend Web Development and a strong desire to push the boundaries of technology. I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics and Computer Science at Kirinyaga University, where I combine my love for logic and problem-solving with cutting-edge technology.
                <br><br>
                My journey in technology began at a young age, driven by an unquenchable curiosity to understand how things work. This passion led me to dive into coding, where I discovered my love for creating functional and beautiful user interfaces. As a Frontend Web Developer, I have gained hands-on experience in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and Iâ€™m continuously learning new tools and techniques to improve my skills.
                <br><br>
                I am also an aspiring AI & ML Engineer with a strong interest in how artificial intelligence can revolutionize industries and enhance lives. I have always believed in the power of technology to solve real-world problems, and AI offers immense potential in fields ranging from healthcare to cybersecurity.
                <br><br>
                Beyond development, I am a creative individual with a passion for design. As a Graphic Designer and Video Editor, I bring my technical skills to life with stunning visuals and captivating multimedia content. My goal is to create seamless user experiences through a combination of functionality and aesthetics.
                <br><br>
                In addition to my academic pursuits, I am the leader of the Ajira Digital Club at Kirinyaga University, a position that allows me to empower my peers with digital skills, leadership experience, and exposure to the ever-evolving tech world. I enjoy mentoring others and inspiring the next generation of tech innovators.
                <br><br>
                Cybersecurity is another area that I am deeply interested in, as I believe that securing digital systems is crucial for the advancement of technology. The increasing prevalence of cyber threats and attacks motivates me to explore ways to safeguard online data and protect individuals and organizations.
                <br><br>
                My vision is to become a full-stack developer with a specialization in AI and cybersecurity. I aim to build scalable, secure, and innovative applications that have a meaningful impact on users' lives. Through continuous learning, collaboration, and a relentless pursuit of excellence, I am committed to achieving my goals and contributing to the global tech community.
